# rock-paper-scissors

this is javascript project from TheOdinProject - an open source website with web devlopment.

also my first js project.

this is a popular rock paper scissor between a user and computer.

here, computer throws any choice randomly and compares it with user and this game is played 5 rounds and it determines the winner by scores.


and at last it displays who's the winner.
